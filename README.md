# The-Hobbit-via-Interactive-Coding
Go on an adventure and make some decisions along the way. Be careful what you choose or how you answer because it can affect your outcome!

This is an interactive story written in code that I created on replit.com while going through 100 Days of Coding; a class hosted on Udemy.com
The course goes over and introduces students to python programming and helps you create many projects. This project specifically helped me gain an understanding of
certain functions like if/then statements, coding logical operators, and code flow. 

Hopefully you enjoy going through the story as much as I enjoyed creating it!
